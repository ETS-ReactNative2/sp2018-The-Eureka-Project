### 4. Express
Express is a web application framework for web/mobile applications (https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
https://thishosting.rocks/getting-started-with-express-js-server-setup/

**Getting Started**

> npm install express-generator -g

> npm install express-dot-engine

> express backwords

> cd backwords

> npm install

> cd bin

Then open up `www` file in VS and modify the following:

`server.listen(port, '171.27.43.141')`

**How to Run The Server**

In the terminal, in the backwords directory, run the following command

> DEBUG=backwords:* npm start

Now go to the web server and test your app by visiting `http://172.27.43.141:3000`

Once Node is installed, we can build our first webserver with Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/)
* After that, run your web server using `node app.js`, visit http://localhost:3000, and you will see a message 'Hello World'

How does Node.js work?

### 5. Axios Library
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

### 6. MySQL

### 7. Configuring a Remote Desktop for Ubuntu

We want to make it so that this is a desktop, not just a server (AKA we want a UI), so that we can connect to our VM from our computers without only having the command line. 

Thus, the way we are going to configure this is by first making our server into a desktop:

Then we are going to configure remote access _on_ our desktop to allow other computers to use it:

OR https://www.howtoforge.com/configure-remote-access-to-your-ubuntu-desktop

As a Mac user, you will be able to connect to the server like this:
